# KustomBot
A customizable bot for Twitch.  

This is just a simple project I made for a friend.  
Use https://twitchapps.com/tmi to get your authentication token.  

I am releasing this project to the public hoping that it will be helpful for beginners trying to learn JavaScript.  

PS: Don't mind the commit messages, I'm just having some fun. :)
